## 2. Introduction
Volume Cap is a lightweight desktop application that helps protect your ears by limiting the maximum volume output of your PC. 

Designed for users who want to maintain safe listening levels, Volume Cap runs quietly in the background and ensures your system volume never exceeds a healthy threshold.

### How to open the UI?
Search the shortcut name in the Windows search bar (the shortcut is added to the Start Menu, so it‚Äôs searchable).

Right after the first download app is not yet launched, so you need to launch it and then do it one more time for the UI to appear.

After closing UI using X button the app continues to run in the background.

The app can be found from Task Manager under background processes.

## 4. Note
My antivirus said my own software was acting "suspicious", whatever that means (probably because the app creates a .txt file to store the volume cap value between computer sessions; or because it changes system settings-the volume nob; or it looks for the current audio device in use; or because it is a python script running in the background, thus an antivirus might automatically flag it as "suspicious"; whatever the reason, the release version is safe even if antivirus might tell you otherwise). 

If you don't trust the release, you can clone the code and compile it yourself using tools like `PyInstaller`, form  there continue like you would normally with steps 2 and 3.
